## Design Process
### The video interface
The first task is to come up with an interface that holds multiple videos. What came to my mind was the screen of a doorman, or a broadcast instructor's monitor. It has multiple small screens on it and gives the user an overview about all the screens. With this in mind, I decided to show four screens in a row and all user can append videos all the way down.

### The gesture input interface
I am not sure about the scenario when users are going to use gesture to control this interface but I do know that some of the laptops supports touch screen, and people can also use these gestures on their phone. I propose an overlay screen that lies on top of all the videos. By doing so, I maximized the canvas that the user can put there gesture, but also sacrificed the ability to let user input specific which video they're interacting. (By using a single gesture canvas for each video, we can easily identify which video to the user is interacting with) This added a lot of tasking for designing gestures to let user navigate between videos.


### The gestures
I categorized gestures into several categories. 
- Gestures that could be executed right away without specifying which video they're refering to.
| Function| Gesture |
|-----|-----|
| Add Video | A |
